## Proejct 3 - Data Analysis with R

A project using R to do some basic exploratory data analysis on a red wine dataset.

## Project 4 - Identify Fraud from Enron Email

A machine learning project using Python to build a model from existing Enron Fraud training dataset such that we can predict if an individual was a "Person of Interest" (POI) in the fraud by his/her financial and email data.

## Project 5 - Data Visualization and D3

A HTML+D3.js project to explore a dataset containing 113,937 loan records from Prosper. The visualization focuses on the relationship between the original loan amount, state of address of the borrowers and the year of original loan.

## Project 6 - A/B Testing

A project that demonstrates different considerations when doing a A/B testing, including invariant and evaluation metrics selection, sizing and power, sanity checks, effect size tests and sign tests.
