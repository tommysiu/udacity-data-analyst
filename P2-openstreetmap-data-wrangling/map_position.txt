Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. It is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, which has a population more than 7 million with quite limited land. It is also one of the world's leading global financial centres, which makes it a very busy place.

Hong Kong is the place where I was born and still living, and I am curious about the quality and accuracy of OpenStreetMap data about this place.
